# Water Potability

## Overview
This project analyzes water quality data to determine its potability using machine learning techniques. Potable water is crucial for health and well-being, and this analysis aids in identifying whether a water sample is safe for consumption.

## Features
- **Dataset:** Utilizes water quality metrics such as pH, hardness, and others to classify water as potable or not.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implements various models to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualizes trends and relationships between water quality parameters.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VISHNU-VARDHAN-MAMIDISETTI/Water-portabality.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Water-portabality
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Run the notebook `/notebooks/water_potability.ipynb` to preprocess data, train the model, and analyze results.
3. Check the `results/` directory for evaluation metrics and visualizations.

## Results
The project classifies water samples as **potable** or **non-potable** with high accuracy. Key insights and visualizations can be found in the notebook and `results/` directory.
